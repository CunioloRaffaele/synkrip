<br><br>
This project uses my private API keys to fetch playlists from Spotify but, these keys, are subject to rate limits and restrictions. To ensure uninterrupted usage, it is highly recommended that you generate and use your own API keys. Instructions for setting up your own API keys can be found in the respective service's developer documentation.
<br>
For YouTube Music, SoundCloud, and Apple Music, I am utilizing the privte API endpoints of the respective services. This means that the app may not work as expected if these endpoints change or are deprecated. I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using these private APIs.
<br>

This project was created for fun during my free time and has not been meticulously polished or professionally maintained. Use it as-is, and feel free to contribute or improve it!
