This project uses my private API keys for services like Spotify. However, these keys, are subject to rate limits and restrictions imposed by Spotify. To ensure uninterrupted usage, it is highly recommended that you generate and use your own API keys. Instructions for setting up your own API keys can be found in the respective service's developer documentation.
